extends Node3D
## An [Item] lying in the world, Zelda style: walk up and the [ActionPrompt] appears with the Action button read
## as "Pick Up"; Action puts [member count] of [member item] in the Player's [Inventory] and the pickup is gone.
## An item with a [member Item.model_scene] (what the inventory preview turns) lies here as that model, turning
## on the spot with its base on the ground; without one, or a mesh child of your own, its icon floats over the spot.
## The prompt and the label are up only while the Player is in the detection area and go down when they leave,
## when the pickup is taken, or when it vanishes (another peer took it).

signal picked_up(player: Player, count: int) ## Emitted with how many the Player took.

const TURN_SECONDS: float = 6.0 ## One full turn of the model.
