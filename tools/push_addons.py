r"""Push addon edits made in this project back to the addon's own repository.

The mirror of tools/pull_addons.py. For each addon it copies addons/<name>/ over a clone of that
addon's repository, and if anything changed, commits it there and pushes to the ref the manifest
names. addons/ is git-ignored here, so this project's own history only ever records the new commit
in tools/addons.lock.json.

    python tools/push_addons.py -m "add the sitting animations"          every addon that differs
    python tools/push_addons.py 3d_player_controller -m "..."            only this one
    python tools/push_addons.py --dry-run                                what differs, and how
    python tools/push_addons.py -m "..." --no-push                       commit upstream, do not push

Always run with --dry-run first. A push here publishes to a repository other projects consume, so
an addon is refused, and the exit code is 1, when its copy was pulled at an older commit than origin
holds now (pull first, or the push would revert what landed upstream since), when its clone under
C:\GitHub has uncommitted work or commits origin does not, or when anything fails. A dry run exits 1
on the same and also when a copy differs, which is what the pre-push hook stops on. It compares in
.addon_cache/ and only fetches in the clones under C:\GitHub, never checking out or merging there.
