class_name EnemyNpc
extends FollowerNpc
## A hostile NPC: idles until the Player attacks it or steps within its aggro area, then chases over the
## navigation mesh and attacks in reach with a melee swing whose weapon hitbox must touch you, a projectile
## weapon, or abilities cast in range with line of sight. When the hunted Player dies, or strays further than
## [member leash_distance] from the post (a respawn far away counts), it turns on any other living Player still
## inside its aggro area or walks back to where it started, stands as it stood and heals to full. A Player in a
## vehicle is never chased: it is attacked while inside attack range and given up on once it drives out of it.
## Locomotion is a blend space (Idle, Walk, Run) fed by a smoothed [member locomotion_blend], as LittleBuddy's is,
## and root motion as for the Player: the navigation decides where to face and how fast it wants to go, and the
## animation's Root bone carries the body. Health, death and the animation state replicate from
## the server; hits from clients relay.
